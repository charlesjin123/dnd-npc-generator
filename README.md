# CJ's DND NPC Generator
## What it Does
Often times when we are playing Dungeons and Dragons, the players would go down unexpected paths that the Dungeon Master would not be able to prepare for. This generator is to help those unfortunate DMs come up with NPCs quickly on the fly. The generated description and image can help the DMs better construct this NPC's personality and describe their appearance. Furthermore, when the players keep on pestering them with annoying questions, simply enter them into the follow-up questions box and the generator will spit out some quick facts for you to respond to the players with.
## Built With
- Next.js for website
- Shadcn for frontend components
- Llama3.1-8b using the Cerebras API for super fast inference to ensure you can answer those questions in time!
- Dall-e-3 for image generation
## How to Run
- Unfortunately I'm using some paid API keys for the models so I won't be able to put them here, but that's why I've attached a video demo below! I can also demo in-person :D
- Otherwise it would be:
  '''
  npm install
  npm run dev
  '''
